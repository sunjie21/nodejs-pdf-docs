# Node.js Manual & Documentation (.pdf, .mobi, .epub)

It all started with my desire to have a nicely formatted version of the node.js manual & documentation
as a printable pdf with a cover, table of content, indented code blocks and so on. Then came requests for a .mobi (Kindle)
file and an .epub (iOS, Android and more) file.

Of course the whole creation and conversion process is written in node.js.

Current version of node.js in the docs: **0.12.5**

## How to use

Just check out the different folders or download directly:

- [pdf](https://github.com/zeMirco/nodejs-pdf-docs/blob/master/pdf/all.pdf?raw=true)
- [epub](https://github.com/zeMirco/nodejs-pdf-docs/blob/master/epub/nodejs-manual.epub?raw=true)
- [mobi](https://github.com/zeMirco/nodejs-pdf-docs/blob/master/mobi/nodejs-manual.mobi?raw=true)

## Create your own files

You need to have [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) installed on your system. All the markdown files from the
[node repository](https://github.com/joyent/node) should be placed inside the markdown folder.

### Create .pdf

1. Use `node app.js` to create the .tex files
2. ~~Manually edit the few files as shown in all.tex (or run `node cleanTex.js`)~~
3. Use `node updateToc.js` to update table of contents
4. Use `latex all.tex` to compile latex file
5. Create the pdf with `pdflatex all.tex`

#### Customizing

Use options.tex and run `latex all.tex` to customize your own manual.

### Create .epub

1. Run `node epub.js` to create the file

### Create .mobi

The .mobi version is created from the .epub file which gives better results compared to converting the .pdf file.

1. Download `kindlegen` from this repository or directly from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621)
2. Run `node mobi.js` to create the file. The file is located inside the epub folder
