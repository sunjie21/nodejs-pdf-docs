	\begin{abstract}
	I sometimes prefer manuals on paper to online references. Taking notes and writing down little hints is much easier. That's why I created this pdf version of the current node.js manual \& documentation. However think about nature and our environment before printing too many documents!

	All the content is taken from the \href{http://www.nodejs.org}{node.js homepage} / its \href{https://github.com/joyent/node}{github repository}.

	I used \href{http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/}{pandoc} to convert the .markdown files to .tex files. They were then converted into a .pdf file with pdfLaTeX.

	You can find the project on \href{https://github.com/zeMirco/nodejs-pdf-docs}{github}.
